# First CronJob

* Create a simply deployment of type `CronJob` that your own code.

* Make your cronjob run every 1 minute.

* Make your code fail once every 5 runs by random (pick a random number between 1 and 5 and if it's 1 crash).

* Answer the question: what does k8s do when a cron job crashes?
