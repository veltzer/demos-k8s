- Same as the hello, create a docker image with a web server.
- import it into the local microk8s repo
- run two pods with that image
- create a load balancer which is connected to the two pods.
- expose the ip/port of the load balancer.
- see that you can access the load balancer.

In this exercise you are creating 3 k8s objects: 2 pods and 1 load balancer.
And we connecting them in a very specific way:

							------- POD1
							|
			LB (with exposed IP/PORT) ------|
							|
							------- POD2
